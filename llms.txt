**amore** (Advanced Modelling of Relational Events) is an R package for
**simulation and inference** in relational event models (REMs). It
targets dynamic network data in continuous time, with a focus on
reproducible workflows: event logs, covariates, model fitting, and
diagnostics.

## What it aims to provide

- **Simulation** utilities for relational event streams and exogenous
  covariates.
- **Inference** tools for fitting REMs and working with likelihood-based
  / counting-process formulations.
- **Covariate engineering** helpers for both exogenous and endogenous
  statistics (e.g., reciprocity, recency, shared partners), in a
  consistent API.

## Installation

``` r
# install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("franciscorichter/amore")

# alternatively, install from a local checkout
install.packages(".", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

``` r
library(amore)
```

## Quick start

``` r
set.seed(1)

actors <- LETTERS[1:5]

covs <- simulate_actor_covariates(
  senders = actors,
  receivers = actors,
  covariate_names = c("activity", "popularity"),
  seed = 123
)

events <- simulate_relational_events(
  n_events = 100,
  senders = actors,
  receivers = actors,
  event_rate = 2,
  sender_covariates = covs$sender_covariates[, c("activity", "popularity")],
  sender_effects = c(0.8, -0.2),
  allow_loops = FALSE
)

head(events)
```

## Inference (package is growing)

The project scope includes estimation and inference for relational event
models. The specific fitting functions will evolve as new estimators and
covariate engines land, so the README stays intentionally high-level.

If you are looking for a particular model family (e.g., Cox-type REMs,
piecewise-constant hazards, Bayesian variants), please open an issue and
describe the data structure you want to support.
